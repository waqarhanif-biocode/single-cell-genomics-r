Complete single-cell RNA-seq analysis guidelines in R

These guidelines are written by Waqar Hanif. LinkedIn: 

These guideliens assume that you understand the basics of molecular biology and have some basics knowhow of single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies. 

The code guidelines given below are specifically for 10X Genomics generated data, specifically for both V2 and V3 chemistries. 

The guidelines are focused towards prostate cancer dataset obtained from 10X Genomics V2 chemistry, however you can follow these guidelines to reproduce these results on pretty much any disease as long as you have V2 or V3 datasets generated from 10X Genomics.
